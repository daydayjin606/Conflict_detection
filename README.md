# Conflict_detection by using deel learning model

# Objective
### Real-time traffic conflict detection is critical to intelligent traffic safety systems. However, real-time large-scale conflict estimation is still challenging due to high-efficiency requirements. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach leveraging deep learning models for real-time conflict detection.
